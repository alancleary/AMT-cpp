# AMT: Array Mapped Trie
A repository contains a C++ implementation of the array mapped trie (AMT) data structure based on the _Bitwise trie with bitmap_ article on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_trie_with_bitmap).
The code was originally implemented as part of another project that has since moved away from the AMT data structure.
The code has been deposited here for posterity.
Feel free to open a PR if you want to add functionality or make this into a proper library.

## Compile

```bash
cmake -B build .
cmake --build build
```

## Run

```bash
./build/amt
```
